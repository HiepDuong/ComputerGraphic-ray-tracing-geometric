4 png is problem1 2 3

I add shape.h a vector color, and call constructor to set color for each object in red green blue

I change scence::trace for problem 2 and 3

I add Plane.h/cpp for problem 1 with the math logic come from third party and by understanding the SPHERE from third party and this homework code

My Phong shading is based on problem 2 

For problem 3 I use third party and understand the logic behind it, 

The comment in cpp will tell what will create by the function
I use visual studio in window 10

Gemetric primitives basic shape (sphere, plane) 

Ray tracing: simulates how light interact with object

Transformation: move, scale the shape

Shading model: reflect light

Lighting Models: simulate different light sources
